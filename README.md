Overall I am happy with my code here except a small problem with the bg curve image on the bigger screen sizes. I THOUGHT I was being clever by setting the background-color of the section below it to the same color as the bg-image which I copied from the svg and it worked perfectly for the mobile size. For the larger sizes I tried making the bg-image wider but it had a max width it seems. then I tried making the bottom section have rounded corners with border-radius but the slope wasn't right. But no bother, it still looks alright.

The JS was fun although maybe I was a bit repetitive. And I thought I would show off by creating all these data-set properties like Kyle (WebDev) does but then, of course, I couldn't use the .classList.add("active) so I had to change some back to classes! But there are worse things in life :)
